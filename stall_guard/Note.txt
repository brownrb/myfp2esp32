I revisited the tuning test program.
Made some improvements, a video and a document with instructions…
It’s now relatively simple to determine the STALL_VALUE to be used in the focuser.
If you read the doc and watch the video, it will become clear I hope…
In case it isn’t, let me know and I'll try to explain it better.
