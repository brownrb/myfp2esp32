myFP2ELibs Libraries, and in that folder 
There should be ZIP files
	myHalfStepperESP32
	myOLED
	myDallasTemperature
	myfp2eIRemoteESP8266
	esp8266-oled-ssd1306

Import these into the Arduino IDE first. Use the Sketch Library Add ZIP Library to import them.
Do not edit or replace any of these files. They have been edited and modified to use with the myFP2ESP controllers.

* OLED_TEXT requires libray myOLED
* OLED_GRAPHIC requires library esp8266-oled-ssd1306
